Frontend:
1. Creating a side bar:
    - I learned how to use aside tag in html
    - Incorporated online tutorials and used tailwindcss
2. Making sure that all pages of the SPA are centered, including the sidebar and the actual 
page content. Used HOC to make sure the stylings are aligned between all components (centered)

###
3. Allow caching, so that when the user refreshes the browser, their past search result
still exists on the page
4. Enable advanced filters (more nutrient options) in the form of a dropdown

Backend:
1. In the search page, we limit the number of API calls by only fetching data from an API
when the user clicks search after inputting into fields of filters. We did not 
want to excessively call the public API as we are limited the number of uses.
2. Validations of user inputs in the backend

### 
3. The backend still does not fetch the data properly (returning the same data everytime).
Fix this.
