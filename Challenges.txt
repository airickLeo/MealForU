Frontend:
1. Creating a side bar:
    - I learned how to use aside tag in html
    - Incorporated online tutorials and used tailwindcss
2. Making sure that all pages of the SPA are centered, including the sidebar and the actual 
page content. Used HOC to make sure the stylings are aligned between all components (centered)
